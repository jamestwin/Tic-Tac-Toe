## To Do:
- Refactor Code
- Apply ES6 standards to functions and replace if statements with ternary operators(if applicable) for cleaner code 
- Focus on edge cases more
- Handle errors
- Optimize incorrect input handling
- Create new branch for fully interactable game between two players instaed of just simulation of computers playing.
- Create new branch for alternate versions of game e.g. 4x4 grid, different rules, 
  Do some research for alternate versions that other people have come up with
- For assessment, create new repository and redo the development of game, implementing agile approach, sprints, split up game into components like game functionality, conditions, player interaction, game logic
